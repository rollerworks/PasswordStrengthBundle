`$passwordStrength = 0;` should be changed to 1 or else you will never reach 5 points.

Great work :+1:

Thanks :+1:
There are 5 points where  $passwordStrength++ is executed. That should result in strength = 5.
It might be a bit confusing that I've combined the following 2 rules in 1 if statement:

* alpha character
* lowercase and uppercase alpha character

However they will both give an extra point. So I think it should be correct now.

Ah my bad :) ` if ($passLength > 12)` was hidden in diff.
