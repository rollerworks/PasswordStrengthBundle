Strength validation
===================

You can use the ```Rollerworks\Bundle\PasswordStrengthBundle\Validator\Constraints\PasswordStrength```
constraint with the following options.

* message: The validation message (default: password_to_weak)
* minLength: Minimum length of the password, should be at least 6 (or 8 for better security)
* minStrength: Minimum required strength of the password.

The strength is computed from various measures including
length and usage of (special) characters.

    Note: A strength is measured by the presence of a character and total length.
    One can have a 'medium' password consisting of only a-z and A-Z, but with a length higher then 12 characters.

    If the password consists of only numbers or a-z/A-Z the final strength is decreased.

The strengths are marked up as follow.

*  1: Very Weak (any character)
*  2: Weak (at least one lower and capital)
*  3: Medium (at least one lower and capital and number)
*  4: Strong (at least one lower and capital and number) (recommended for most usage)
*  5: Very Strong (recommended for admin or finance related service)

If you are using annotations for validation, include the constraints namespace:

```php
use Rollerworks\Bundle\PasswordStrengthBundle\Validator\Constraints as RollerworksPassword;
```

and then add the PasswordStrength validator to the relevant field:

```php

/**
 * @RollerworksPassword\PasswordStrength(minLength=7, minStrength=3)
 */
protected $password;
```
